# A matches game 

### Android

## App description

This is a strategic game in which there are a quantity of matches, and each game can take in turn 1-3 matches (or some you set in the settings) ..<br>
The winner is the one who took the last match
<br><br>
Of course there is an strategy of how to solve the task and it depends on who starts first and the amount of matches in the remaining division of the amount of matches you can take +1
<br>
I developed a computer player that works according to a simple algorithm that solves the problem.
<br><br>

You can play 2 players (in the same cellphone and not online)
<br><br>

I've included screenshots, and an .apk file of the app<br>
